<article><h1>Data Driven Development</h1>
    <p>Published: 16-1-2022</p>
    <h2>Concept</h2>
<p>Throughout my career I have strived to acknowledge where <strong>Studying, Modeling and Collecting</strong> data can improve both the current and next project.</p>
<p>Specifically, this can come in the form of:</p>
<h2>Studying</h2>
<p>By investigating existing data during the startup of a project the projects goals and constraints can be clearly outlined as well as existing assumptions be validated or checked.</p>
<p>During a the foundation of a project to create a new Carpet Jacquard, while the projects constraints were being set. I suggested that the existing set of measurements and load assessments from the previous machine should be investigated.</p>
<p>I combined the information from direct Strain measurements, with energy based models of the load requirements of the jacquards. </p>
<p>I was able to identify that there was a singular load case that was dominating the load cycle of the machine. This allowed the project requirements to be more finely refined to this singular load case, increasing the accuracy of the future assessments and decreasing the time the project would take significantly.</p>
<h2>Modeling</h2>
<p>By modeling trends, variable changes and generating new datasets, a better understanding of the driving factors behind qualitative or quantitative results can be had. </p>
<p>A project to reduce the spring load on a carpet Jacquard harness was started to reduce the strength required by the rest of the Jacquard installation.</p>
<p>My task was to assess the knock on impact on the weave and other components of modifying the spring. </p>
<p>The Measured data set was limited by the pre-selected springs that had been used. I took the data sets and created a variable model which could reasonably convert one spring measurement into another. I confirmed that this worked between all the springs in the data set, then set out optimising for the Tasks goal.</p>
<p>There was an best choice of spring offered but it had negative effects on the appearance of the weave due to not managing congestion issues in the harness. Through the variable model i was able to propose an optimum spring to production.</p>
<h3>Collecting</h3>
<p>Improved data collection allows the previous 2 concepts to be deployed to greater effect. It is important to make the burden of data collection low to allow colleagues to focus on their main tasks.</p>
<p>While managing the R&amp;D of a product I was aware that there was some recording of production data. </p>
<p>I created a Python applications which connected different pieces of data and displayed them with a dashboard. This allowed me to present the potential of this data collection to management and planning.</p>
<p>The project allowed some investment in data collection to be opened up and furthermore the direct connection of this data for future analysis. It was immediately used by Production planning to improve order planning.</p>
<p>The burden of this data collection was reduced in a future project by collecting it at the source rather than the receiver.</p></article>
